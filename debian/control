Description: Data files for the game beret.
 A 2D puzzle-platformer game about a scientist, astonishingly named Beret,
 who has gained telekinetic abilities through his research at the Evil Corporation.
 He decides that the Evil Corporation is a tad too evil for his liking, and begins
 his solitary quest to overthrow the corporation and punish the evil deeds of his
 employers. Beret has 21 puzzle-filled levels, 120 collectable Medallions, over
 20 hours of gameplay, and an unlockable level editor.
