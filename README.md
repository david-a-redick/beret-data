# Beret

Beret is a 2D puzzle-platformer game about a scientist, astonishingly named Beret,
who has gained telekinetic abilities through his research at the Evil Corporation.
He decides that the Evil Corporation is a tad too evil for his liking, and begins
his solitary quest to overthrow the corporation and punish the evil deeds of his
employers. Beret has 21 puzzle-filled levels, 120 collectable Medallions, over
20 hours of gameplay, and an unlockable level editor.

# Building

While the source code can be compiled and packaged by itself,
you'll need both the [beret source code](https://github.com/david-a-redick/beret)
and the [beret-data](https://github.com/david-a-redick/beret-data) to run the game.

These commands work for both source and data:

```shell
# View various variable defaults.
make echo

make

make install
```

# Dependencies
